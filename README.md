#### By _**Ben Dunham**_

## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _CSS_

## Description

_This portfolio page details my history, interests, path to becoming a Developer, and provides links to previous programming projects available on Github_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone page from Github down to your desktop via command ``git clone``_
* _Navigate to index.html and open in browser of your choice_


_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
